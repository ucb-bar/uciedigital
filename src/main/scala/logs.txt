+ TODOs
  - Remove redundant params in SidebandParams and keep them in AfeParams
    Redundant signals sbWidth == sbLinkWidth
    - sbNodeMsgWidth seems useless because there's no serializer/deserialzer in between modules,
      so that value will always be 128. 
        - Probably have an assert that enforces 128 and if there's a change say there's no serdes
          between layers, so can't do it.


+ DESIGN LOG
  SidebandLinkSerdes
  - When deserializer times out, do we going into a link error and trigger a reset with software?
    According to spec, sideband should have a BER of 1e-27 or better. Can likely afford a full reset
    instead of a independent SB link serdes reset.


+ VERIFICATION LOG
  SidebandLinkSerdes
    - Need to verify the reset functionality fully of serializer and deserializer
    Currently resets correctly but edge case testing hasn't been done such as:
      - When we reset the sideband serdes independently of full UCIe reset and there is a message 
        coming in. Not sure if this is an edge case that will happen ever.
